Creating C stacks for monty byte code files
The Monty language Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with very specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
